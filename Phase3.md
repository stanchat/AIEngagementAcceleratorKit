## üìç Phase 3: Prototype and Experimentation

In this phase, teams design a prototype and conduct experiments to assess its functionality and effectiveness. With feedback from stakeholders, potential risks are identified and addressed. This iterative process allows for gradual improvements leading up to production deployment.

### Inputs
- Prepared data and chosen model
- Prototype design
- QA and risk mitigation plans
- Stakeholder engagement strategy

### Process
- Develop prototype
- Conduct experiments
- QA team onboarding and process checks
- Risk analysis and mitigation
- Engage users/stakeholders for feedback

### Outputs
- Functional prototype
- Test results
- Feedback collection
- QA approval
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Risk mitigation plan
- Prototype refinement roadmap

### Before Tasks
- Lock prototype design
- QA checklist validation
- Risk identification

### After Tasks
- Iterate based on feedback
- Plan for deployment
- Define rollout strategy
