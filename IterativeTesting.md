# 🔁 Iterative Testing in GenAI Projects

In a Generative AI engagement, iterative testing is essential to continuously validate model outputs, ensure ethical behavior, and improve the user experience.

## 🧪 Why Iteration Matters
- GenAI outputs are probabilistic, not deterministic
- Fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and retraining benefit from constant feedback
- Increases stakeholder confidence through evidence-based progress

## 🔬 Testing Strategies

### ✅ Qualitative Testing
- Manual review of generated outputs
- Prompt/output pair assessments
- UX usability sessions

### 📊 Quantitative Testing
- Accuracy, F1, BLEU, or ROUGE scores
- Latency benchmarks
- Drift detection (model or data)

### 🧭 Real-World Validation
- Test in sandbox or pilot environment
- Simulate real user inputs and edge cases
- Use staged rollout for production

## 🧠 Feedback Loops
- Embed test checkpoints in each sprint
- Include business users in QA
- Create mechanisms for collecting user feedback post-release

## 🛠️ Tools & Enablers
- Streamlit dashboards for reviewing examples
- MLflow or Weights & Biases for tracking experiments
- GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines for automated model tests

Iterative testing helps AI systems become more useful, fair, and trusted with each sprint.
