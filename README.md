# AI Engagement Accelerator Kit

Welcome to the **AI Engagement Accelerator Kit**. This kit is designed to guide teams through the lifecycle of a Generative AI engagementâ€”from using a *data-driven* approach from initial discovery through production deployment. Each phase includes key inputs, processes, outputs, and tasks to help you stay organized and aligned.
