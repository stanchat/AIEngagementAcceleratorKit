# AI Engagement Accelerator Kit

Welcome to the **AI Engagement Accelerator Kit**. This kit is designed to guide teams through the lifecycle of a Generative AI engagement‚Äîfrom initial discovery through production deployment. Each phase includes key inputs, processes, outputs, and tasks to help you stay organized and aligned.

## üß≠ Overview of the Phases

![ Alt Text](URL).

This accelerator is broken down into four structured phases:

1. **Discovery and Feasibility Study** ‚Äì Establish goals, assess feasibility, and align stakeholders.
2. **Data Preparation and Model Selection** ‚Äì Gather and transform data, and select appropriate models.
3. **Prototype and Experimentation** ‚Äì Build, test, and refine the prototype.
4. **Production Deployment and Evolution** ‚Äì Deploy and monitor the solution in a live environment.

You'll also find a helpful **FAQ** to address common questions and considerations for managing AI engagements.

## ‚ùì FAQ: Managing AI Engagements

**Q: What are the common pitfalls in AI engagements?**
A: Misalignment on goals, poor data quality, lack of stakeholder involvement, and underestimating deployment complexity.

**Q: What skills are critical on an AI project team?**
A: Product ownership, data science, MLOps/engineering, legal/ethics, and stakeholder management.

**Q: How do you measure success?**
A: Metrics should tie back to business goals‚Äîe.g., improved efficiency, reduced cost, user satisfaction, and model performance KPIs.

**Q: What's the role of compliance and ethics?**
A: Crucial at every phase‚Äîensure your models align with privacy laws, fairness, transparency, and accountability principles.

**Q: When should you sunset or pivot an AI project?**
A: If it consistently fails to meet KPIs, lacks data, or becomes too costly to sustain/improve.
