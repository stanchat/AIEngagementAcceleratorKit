# ü§ñ Agentic Workflows in GenAI Engagements

Agentic workflows extend the power of Generative AI by enabling models to reason, plan, and take action over multiple steps. Instead of single-prompt interactions, these workflows simulate autonomous or semi-autonomous agents that operate across a series of decisions, often integrating with tools, APIs, or other data sources.

This section introduces agentic design patterns and implementation guides for enterprise-grade GenAI solutions.

## üß† What Are Agentic Workflows?

An **agentic workflow** is a multi-step process in which an AI model:

1. **Interprets a user goal**
2. **Plans a strategy or sequence of actions**
3. **Selects and invokes tools (APIs, search, knowledge bases)**
4. **Reflects or evaluates intermediate steps**
5. **Returns a final answer or actionable output**

Examples include RAG with feedback loops, ReAct-style agents, LangChain agents, or custom-designed orchestration logic.

## üß© Common Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **ReAct** | Reasoning + Acting. Model interleaves thoughts and tool use. | "Search + Summarize + Recommend" flows |
| **Tool-Calling Agent** | Agent selects from multiple tools/APIs based on user input. | Calendar + Email + HRBot agent |
| **Scratchpad Reasoning** | Model uses a memory-like scratchpad to iterate toward an answer. | Multi-step math or logic reasoning |
| **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** | Model pauses for user feedback or approval before proceeding. | Enterprise approval workflows |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example Demo: Agentic PDF Knowledge Assistant

Use Streamlit or a notebook to:

- Let user upload a PDF
- Parse into chunks and store in vector store
- Agent executes:
  1. Search chunks
  2. Reflect and verify scope
  3. Compose answer or action (e.g. email summary)

Tools used: FAISS/Chroma, OpenAI/HF LLM, LangChain Agent, Streamlit.

> A notebook + Streamlit demo will be provided for this use case.
- [Agentic Streamlit App](streamlit_apps/agentic_pdf_assistant.py)
- [Agentic Notebook](/notebooks/agentic_pdf_assistant.ipynb)

## üßë‚Äçüíº Suggested Use Case: Microsoft Internal Support Agent

**Scenario**: Support engineers want an agent that can:
- Search internal KBs (indexed PDFs + Notion)
- Query GitHub issues + telemetry (via API tool)
- Draft templated responses for enterprise support tickets

**Agent Workflow**:
- Input: Ticket text
- Step 1: RAG from internal documents
- Step 2: Query logs via API tool
- Step 3: Summarize findings into a draft resolution
- Step 4: Include citation + confidence scores
