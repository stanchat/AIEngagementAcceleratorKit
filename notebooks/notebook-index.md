# ğŸ““ Notebook Index for GenAI Engagement Kit

This page provides an overview of the core notebooks included in the project. These interactive Jupyter notebooks walk through prompt engineering, LangChain pipelines, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), evaluation metrics, and sandboxing ideas. All notebooks support both **OpenAI** and **Hugging Face** integrations.

## âœ… Getting Started

Make sure your `.env` file is set up with the following:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
HF_TOKEN=your-huggingface-token
VECTOR_DB_API_KEY=your-pinecone-api-key
VECTOR_DB_INDEX=your-index-name
```

Run this in terminal:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> _These notebooks are modular. Use them independently or in sequence, depending on your use case._
