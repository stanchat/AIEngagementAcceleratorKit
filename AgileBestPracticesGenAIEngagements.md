## ðŸ“‹ Agile Best Practices for GenAI Engagements

Adopting Agile methodologies is key to navigating the uncertainty and experimentation that comes with Generative AI. AI initiatives benefit from a blend of traditional Scrum/Kanban and lean startup practices.

### ðŸ§ª Hypothesis-Driven Development

In GenAI projects, it's often unclear whether a solution will achieve the desired outcome. That's why hypothesis-driven development (HDD) is essential.

Instead of simply building features, teams frame ideas as **testable hypotheses** that include assumptions, intended outcomes, and success metrics.

#### Example Format:
> We believe that **[this solution]** will result in **[this outcome]**. We will have confidence to proceed when we see **[this metric]**.

### ðŸš€ Why It's Important
- Encourages experimentation and fast feedback
- Reduces wasted investment in unproven ideas
- Aligns product, design, and engineering on learning goals
- Drives data-informed iteration, not just delivery

### ðŸ“Œ Best Practices:
- Prioritize **uncertainty** early: what must be learned before scaling?
- Use **Hypothesis-Driven Stories** alongside user or job stories
- Review hypotheses during sprint planning and retros
- Define clear success criteria that validate outcomes, not just completion

By embracing HDD, AI teams move faster and smarterâ€”testing assumptions and evolving their models based on evidence.
