## 🗂️ Starter Backlog Artifacts for GenAI Projects

A well-structured product backlog is one of the most powerful accelerators for any AI project. To streamline onboarding, planning, and delivery, we’ve included **starter backlog templates** compatible with both **Jira** and **Azure DevOps**.

These backlogs contain pre-defined **user stories**, **tasks**, and **epics** tailored to each phase of a typical GenAI engagement, from discovery to deployment.

### 💡 Why a Starter Backlog?
- Reduces ramp-up time for new teams
- Creates shared understanding across roles
- Ensures phase readiness and coverage
- Provides traceability from goals to execution

### 📁 What's Included:

#### Jira
- **JiraImportGuide.md** – How to import CSV into Jira Projects
- **Product_Backlog_With_Work_Item_Type.csv** – Flat backlog with labels for `Story`, `Task`, and `Epic`

#### Azure DevOps
- **AzureDevOpsImportGuide.md** – Walkthrough for importing via Azure Boards
- **Hierarchical_Product_Backlog.xlsx / .csv** – Includes relationships between Epics > Features > Stories

### 🔄 Format Variants
- `.csv` versions for easy import/export and Git diffing
- `.xlsx` versions for quick editing and planning in Excel

> You can use these as-is, or adapt them to match your internal development model (Scrum, Kanban, SAFe, etc.)

These artifacts are located in the `Product Backlog Template` folder.
